>>> from polls.models import Question, Choice   # Import the model classes we just wrote.

# No questions are in the system yet.
>>> Question.objects.all()
[]

# Create a new Question.
# Support for time zones is enabled in the default settings file, so
# Django expects a datetime with tzinfo for pub_date. Use timezone.now()
# instead of datetime.datetime.now() and it will do the right thing.
>>> from django.utils import timezone
>>> q = Question(question_text="What's new?", pub_date=timezone.now())

# Save the object into the database. You have to call save() explicitly.
>>> q.save()

# objects.all() displays all the questions in the database.
>>> Question.objects.all()
[<Question: Question object>]
